<h1> Chapter 5 Questions</h1>

<ul>
    Question #1:
    <br>
    <p> The hierarchical site organization is used for the JavaJam Website. This is the most appropriate organization for the site because with a clearely defined home page with links to major site sections it will make navigating around the website easier and straight forward for the user regardless of user comfort level.
    </p>
    <br>
    Question #2:
    <br>
    <p> Ways that are well implemented:
        <li>Displays great on Windows/Mac/Mobile</li>
        <li>All the links work, there is nothing more frustrating than going to a website only to have one of the links not work</li>
        <li>Main navigation links are clearly and consistantently labeled, the user doesn't have to look hard to navigate around the website for what section they need</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        Ways that could be implemented and ways that I would improve the website:
        <li>Colors of the website could be easier on the eyes such as a dark mode</li>
        <li>Under the music page add links to the artists profile/website for the website visitor to get more information on the artist that is featured</li>
        <li>For the footer, I would add a music player with a playlist of coffee house jams for easy listening for the user.</li>
        <li>I would add more pictures of the featured menu items and pictures of the shop itself to give the allure of what the customer would expect to see at the coffee shop, viewing it as a consumer of coffee shops if I'm going to dine in at a coffee shop atmosphere is everything to me.</li>
</p></ul>
